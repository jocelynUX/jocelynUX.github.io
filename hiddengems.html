            <p><strong>Project Overview</strong></p>
            <p>
              <em>Hidden Gems</em> is a user experience design project centered
              around an app that helps users explore and discover lesser-known
              places in their neighborhood. The project aimed to create an
              engaging experience for users who want to uncover local gems,
              enjoy spontaneous adventures, and support small businesses.

          <p><strong>Design Objective</strong></p>
          <p>
            The primary goal was to design an app that promotes serendipitous
            discovery of hidden gems in familiar environments. We wanted users
            to feel a sense of wonder and curiosity while exploring new places
            in their own neighborhoods, moving away from traditional
            research-heavy approaches to focus on spontaneous exploration.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Research and Insights</strong></p>
          <p>
            Through interviews and user research, we discovered that long-time
            residents of a city often become complacent in their familiar
            surroundings. Despite a desire for discovery, they may struggle to
            push their boundaries due to decision fatigue and a perception that
            they already know what they like. Users preferred non-intrusive,
            casual exploration and wanted recommendations from local residents
            rather than generic, broad suggestions.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Design Process</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Initial Ideation</strong></li>
          </ol>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Developed the core concept of an app that encourages users to
              explore hidden gems around them.
            </li>
            <li>
              Created initial sketches and mid-fidelity wireframes to outline
              the user flow and interactions.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Key Scenarios and Personas</strong></li>
          </ol>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Created personas like FOMO Fred and Startup Stella to represent
              our target users and guide the design process.
            </li>
            <li>
              Developed key scenarios to explore users’ goals, motivations, and
              pain points.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ol>

          </ol>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Mapped out the user interaction with the app, including
              information flow and user preferences.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ensured the app's recommendations were tailored to reduce decision
              fatigue and enhance user experience.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ol>

          </ul>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Prototyping and Testing</strong></li>
          </ol>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Conducted user testing with a medium-fidelity prototype in Figma.
            </li>
            <li>
              Users explored test locations and provided feedback, which led to
              further refinements.
            </li>
            <li>
              Created a commercial to showcase the app’s features and user
              experience.

              decisions, iterations, and user feedback.
